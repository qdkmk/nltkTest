      "\n",
      "07 Aug 2019 Rachel Thomas\n",
      "Over 225 police departments have partnered with Amazon to have access to Amazon’s video footage obtained as part of the “smart” doorbell product Ring, and in many cases these partnerships are heavily subsidized with taxpayer money. Police departments are allowing Amazon to stream 911 call information directly in real-time, and Amazon requires police departments to read pre-approved scripts when talking about the program. If a homeowner doesn’t want to share data from their video camera doorbell with police, an officer for the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office said they can just go directly to Amazon to obtain it. This creation of an extensive surveillance network, the murky private-public partnership surrounding it, and a lack of any sort of regulations or oversight is frightening.  And this is just one of many examples related to surveillance technology that have recently come to light.\n",
      "I frequently talk with people who are not that concerned about surveillance, or who feel that the positives outweigh the risks. Here, I want to share some important truths about surveillance:\n",
      "\n",
      "Surveillance can facilitate human rights abuses and even genocide\n",
      "Data is often used for different purposes than why it was collected\n",
      "Data often contains errors\n",
      "Surveillance typically operates with no accountability\n",
      "Surveillance changes our behavior\n",
      "Surveillance disproportionately impacts the marginalized\n",
      "Data privacy is a public good\n",
      "We don’t have to accept invasive surveillance\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was writing this post, a number of investigative articles came out with disturbing new developments related to surveillance. I decided that rather than attempt to include everything in one post (which would make it too long and too dense), I would go ahead and share the above facts about surveillance, as they are just a relevant as ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last 24 hours:- NYC police using facial recognition on 11 year old kids- Cops are giving Amazon real-time 911 caller data- California Facial Recognition Interconnect- contd facial rec on protesters in Hong Kong- Palantir founder Peter Thiel gets op-ed in NYTimes— Rachel Thomas (@math_rachel) August 2, 2019 \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Surveillance can facilitate human rights abuses and even genocide\n",
      "There is a long history of data about sensitive attributes being misused, including the use of the 1940 USA Census to intern Japanese Americans, a system of identity cards introduced by the Belgian colonial government that were later used during the 1994 Rwandan genocide (in which nearly a million people were murdered), and the role of IBM in helping Nazi Germany use punchcard computers to identify and track the mass killing of millions of Jewish people. More recently, the mass internment of over one million people who are part of an ethnic minority in Western China was facilitated through the use of a surveillance network of cameras, biometric data (including images of people’s faces, audio of their voices, and blood samples), and phone monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Adolf Hitler meeting with IBM CEO Tom Watson Sr. in 1937.  Source: Computer History\n",
      "\n",
      "Pictured above is Adolf Hitler (far left) meeting with IBM CEO Tom Watson Sr. (2nd from left), shortly before Hitler awarded Watson a special “Service to the Reich” medal in 1937 (for a timeline of the Holocaust, see here). Watson returned the medal in 1940, although IBM continued to do business with the Nazis. IBM technology helped the Nazis conduct detailed censuses in countries they occupied, to thoroughly identify anyone of Jewish descent. Nazi concentration camps used IBM’s punchcard machines to tabulate prisoners, recording whether they were Jewish, gay, or Gypsies, and whether they died of “natural causes,” execution, suicide, or via “special treatment” in gas chambers. It is not the case that IBM sold the machines and then was done with it. Rather, IBM and its subsidiaries provided regular training and maintenance on-site at the concentration camps: printing off cards, configuring machines, and repairing them as they broke frequently.\n",
      "2. Data is often used for different purposes than why it was collected\n",
      "In the above examples, the data collection began before genocide was committed. IBM began selling to Nazi Germany well before the Holocaust (although continued for far too long), including helping with Germany’s 1933 census conducted by Adolf Hitler, which was effective at identifying far more Jewish people than had previously been recognized in Germany.\n",
      "It is important to recognize how data and images gathered through surveillance can be weaponized later. Columbia professor Tim Wu wrote that “One [hard truth] is that data and surveillance networks created for one purpose can and will be used for others. You must assume that any personal data that Facebook or Android keeps are data that governments around the world will try to get or that thieves will try to steal.”\n",
      "Plenty of data collection is not involved with such extreme abuse as genocide; however, in a time of global resurgence of white supremacist, ethno-nationalist, and authoritarian movements, it would be deeply irresponsible to not consider how data & surveillance can and will be weaponized against already vulnerable groups.\n",
      "3. Data often has errors (and no mechanism for correcting them)\n",
      "A database of suspected gang members maintained by California law enforcement officials was found to be full of errors, including 42 babies who had been added to the database when they were less than 1 year old (28 of whom were marked as “admitting to being gang members”).  Even worse, there was no process in place for correcting mistakes or removing people once they’ve been added.\n",
      "An NPR reporter recounts his experience of trying to rent an apartment and discovering that TransUnion, one of the 3 major credit bureaus, incorrectly reported him as having two felony firearms convictions. TransUnion only removed the mistakes after a dozen phone calls and notification that the story would be reported on. This is not an unusual story: the FTC’s large-scale study of credit reports in 2012 found 26% of consumers had at least one mistake in their files and 5% had errors that could be devastating.  An even more opaque, unregulated “4th bureau” exists: a collection of companies buying and selling personal information about people on the margins of the banking system (such as immigrants, students, and people with low incomes), with no standards on what types of data are included, no way to opt out, and no system for identifying or correcting mistakes.\n",
      "4. Surveillance typically operates with no accountability\n",
      "What makes the examples in the previous section disturbing is not just that errors occurred, but that there was no way to identify or correct them, and no accountability for those profiting off the error-laden data. Often, even the existence of the systems being used is not publicly known (much less details of how these systems work), unless discovered by journalists or revealed by whistleblowers. The Detroit Police Dept used facial recognition technology for nearly two years without public input and in violation of a requirement that a policy be approved by the city’s Board of Police Commissioners, until a study from Georgetown Law’s Center for Privacy & Technology drew attention to the issue. Palantir, the defense startup founded by billionaire Peter Thiel, ran a program with New Orleans Police Department for 6 years which city council members did not even know about, much less have any oversight.\n",
      "After two studies found that Amazon’s facial recognition software produced inaccurate and racially biased results, Amazon countered that the researchers should have changed the default parameters.  However, it turned out that Amazon was not instructing police departments that use its software to do this either. Surveillance programs are operating with few regulations, no oversight, no accountability around accuracy or mistakes, and in many cases, no public knowledge of what is going on.\n",
      "5. Surveillance changes our behavior\n",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people in Hong Kong are protesting an unpopular new bill which would allow extradition to China. Typically, Hong Kong locals use their rechargeable smart cards to ride the subway. However, during the protests, long lines of people waited to use cash to buy paper tickets (usually something that only tourists do) concerned that they would be tracked for having attended the protests. Would fewer people protest if this was not an option?\n",
      "In the United States, in 2015 the Baltimore Police Department used facial recognition technology to surveil people protesting the death of Freddie Grey, a young Black man who was killed in police custody, and arrested protesters with outstanding warrants. Mass surveillance could have a chilling impact on our rights to move about freely, to express ourselves, and to protest. “We act differently when we know we are ‘on the record.’ Mass privacy is the freedom to act without being watched and thus in a sense, to be who we really are,” Columbia professor Tim Wu wrote in the New York Times.\n",

      "6. Surveillance disproportionately impacts those who are already marginalized\n",
      "Surveillance is applied unevenly, causing the greatest harm to people who are already marginalized, including immigrants, people of color, and people living in poverty. These groups are more heavily policed and surveilled. The Perpetual Line-Up from the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology studied the unregulated use of facial recognition by police, with half of all Americans appearing in law enforcement databases, and the risks of errors, racial bias, misuses, and threats to civil liberties. The researchers pointed out that African Americans are more likely to appear in these databases (many of which are drawn from mug shots) since they are disproportionately likely to be stopped, interrogated, or arrested.  For another example, consider the contrast between how easily people over 65 can apply for Medicare benefits by filling out an online form, with the invasive personal questions asked of a low-income mother on Medicaid about her lovers, hygiene, parental shortcomings, and personal habits.\n",
      "In an article titled Trading privacy for survival is another tax on the poor, Ciara Byrne wrote, “Current public benefits programs ask applicants extremely detailed and personal questions and sometimes mandate home visits, drug tests, fingerprinting, and collection of biometric information… Employers of low-income workers listen to phone calls, conduct drug tests, monitor closed-circuit television, and require psychometric tests as conditions of employment. Prisoners in some states have to consent to be voiceprinted in order to make phone calls.”\n",
      "7. Data privacy is a public good, like air quality or safe drinking water\n",
      "Data is more revealing in aggregate. It can be nearly impossible to know what your individual data could reveal when combined with the data of others or with data from other sources, or when machine learning inference is performed on it. For instance, as Zeynep Tufekci wrote in the New York Times, individual Strava users could not have predicted how in aggregate their data could be used to identify the locations of US military bases. “Data privacy is not like a consumer good, where you click ‘I accept’ and all is well. Data privacy is more like air quality or safe drinking water, a public good that cannot be effectively regulated by trusting in the wisdom of millions of individual choices. A more collective response is needed.”\n",
      "Unfortunately, this also means that you can’t fully safeguard your privacy on your own.  You may choose not to purchase Amazon’s ring doorbell, yet you can still show up in the video footage collected by others. You might strengthen your online privacy practices, yet conclusions will still be inferred about you based on the behavior of others. As Professor Tufekci wrote, we need a collective response.\n",
      "8. We don’t have to accept invasive surveillance\n",
      "Many people are uncomfortable with surveillance, but feel like they have no say in the matter. While the threats surveillance poses are large, it is not too late to act. We are seeing success: in response to community organizing and an audit, Los Angeles Police Department scrapped a controversial program to predict who is most likely to commit violent crimes.  Citizens, researchers, and activists in Detroit have been effective at drawing attention to the Detroit Police Department’s unregulated use of facial recognition and a bill calling for a 5-year moratorium has been introduced to the state legislature. Local governments in San Francisco, Oakland, and Somerville have banned the use of facial recognition by police.\n",

      "\n",
      "06 Aug 2019 Jeremy Howard\n",
      "The Delegation Problem\n",
      "Let’s look at a problem that all coders have faced; something that I call the delegation problem. To explain, I’ll use an example. Here’s an example class you might see in a content management system:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "class WebPage:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, title, category=\"General\", date=None, author=\"Jeremy\"):\n",
      "        self.title,self.category,self.author = title,category,author\n",
      "        self.date = date or datetime.now()\n",
      "        ...\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, you want to add a subclass for certain types of page, such as a product page. It should have all the details of WebPage, plus some extra stuff. One way to do it would be with inheritance, like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "class ProductPage(WebPage):\n",
      "    def __init__(self, title, price, cost, category=\"General\", date=None, author=\"Jeremy\"):\n",
      "        super().__init__(title, category=category, date=date, author=author)\n",
      "        ...\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But now we’re violating the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principal. We’ve duplicated both our list of parameter names, and the defaults. So later on, we might decide to change the default author to “Rachel”, so we change the definition in WebPage.__init__. But we forget to do the same in ProductPage, and now we have a bug 🐛! (When writing the fastai deep learning library I’ve created bugs many times in this way, and sometimes they’ve been extremely hard to track down, because differences in deep learning hyper-parameters can have very subtle and hard to test or detect implications.)\n",
      "To avoid this, perhaps we could instead write it this way:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "class ProductPage(WebPage):\n",
      "    def __init__(self, title, price, cost, **kwargs):\n",
      "        super().__init__(title, **kwargs)\n",
      "        ...\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to this approach is the use of **kwargs. In python **kwargs in a parameter like means “put any additional keyword arguments into a dict called kwarg. And **kwargs in an argument list means “insert all key/value pairs in the kwargs dict as named arguments here”. This approach is used in many popular libraries, such as matplotlib, in which the main plot function simply has the signature plot(*args, **kwargs). The plot documentation says “The kwargs are Line2D properties” and then lists those properties.\n",
      "It’s not just python that uses this approach. For instance, in the R language the equivalent to **args is simply written ... (an ellipsis). The R documentation explains: “Another frequent requirement is to allow one function to pass on argument settings to another. For example many graphics functions use the function par() and functions like plot() allow the user to pass on graphical parameters to par() to control the graphical output.This can be done by including an extra argument, literally ‘…’, of the function, which may then be passed on”.\n",
      "For more details on using **kwargs in python, Google will find you many nice tutorials, such as this one. The **kwargs solution appears to work quite nicely:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "p = ProductPage('Soap', 15.0, 10.50, category='Bathroom', author=\"Sylvain\")\n",
      "p.author\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sylvain'\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this makes our API quite difficult to work with, because now the environment we’re using for editing our Python code (examples in this article assume we’re using Jupyter Notebook) doesn’t know what parameters are available, so things like tab-completion of parameter names and popup lists of signatures won’t work 😢. In addition, if we’re using an automatic tool for generating API documentation (such as fastai’s show_doc or Sphinx), our docs won’t include the full list of parameters, and we’ll need to manually add information about these delegated parameters (i.e. category, date, and author, in this case). In fact, we’ve seen this already, in matplotlib’s documentation for plot.\n",
      "Another alternative is to avoid inheritance, and instead use composition, like so:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "class ProductPage:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, page, price, cost):\n",
      "        self.page,self.price,self.cost = page,price,cost\n",
      "        ...\n",
      "\n",
      "p = ProductPage(WebPage('Soap', category='Bathroom', author=\"Sylvain\"), 15.0, 10.50)\n",
      "p.page.author\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sylvain'\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This has a new problem, however, which is that the most basic attributes are now hidden underneath p.page, which is not a great experience for our class users (and the constructor is now rather clunky compared to our inheritance version).\n",
      "Solving the problem with delegated inheritance\n",
      "The solution to this that I’ve recently come up with is to create a decorator that is used like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "@delegates()\n",
      "class ProductPage(WebPage):\n",
      "    def __init__(self, title, price, cost, **kwargs):\n",
      "        super().__init__(title, **kwargs)\n",
      "        ...\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "…which looks exactly like what we had before for our inheritance version with kwargs, but has this key difference:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "print(inspect.signature(ProductPage))\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(title, price, cost, category='General', date=None, author='Jeremy')\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out that this approach, which I call delegated inheritance, solves all of our problems; in Jupyter if I hit the standard “show parameters” key Shift-Tab while instantiating a ProductPage, I see the full list of parameters, including those from WebPage. And hitting Tab will show me a completion list including the WebPage parameters. In addition, documentation tools see the full, correct signature, including the WebPage parameter details.\n",
      "To decorate delegating functions instead of class __init__ we use much the same syntax. The only difference is that we now need to pass the function we’re delegating to:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "def create_web_page(title, category=\"General\", date=None, author=\"Jeremy\"):\n",
      "    ...\n",
      "\n",
      "@delegates(create_web_page)\n",
      "def create_product_page(title, price, cost, **kwargs):\n",
      "    ...\n",
      "\n",
      "print(inspect.signature(create_product_page))\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(title, price, cost, category='General', date=None, author='Jeremy')\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I really can’t overstate how significant this little decorator is to my coding practice. In early versions of fastai we used kwargs frequently for delegation, because we wanted to ensure my code was as simple as possible to write (otherwise I tend to make a lot of mistakes!) We used it not just for delegating __init__ to the parent, but also for standard functions, similar to how it’s used in matplotlib’s plot function. However, as fastai got more popular, I heard more and more feedback along the lines of “I love everything about fastai, except I hate dealing with kwargs”! And I totally empathized; indeed, dealing with ... in R APIs and kwargs in Python APIs has been a regular pain-point for me too. But here I was, inflicting it on my users! 😯\n",
      "I am, of course, not the first person to have dealt with this. The Use and Abuse of Keyword Arguments in Python is a thoughtful article which concludes “So it’s readability vs extensibility. I tend to argue for readability over extensibility, and that’s what I’ll do here: for the love of whatever deity/ies you believe in, use **kwargs sparingly and document their use when you do”. This is what we ended up doing in fastai too. Last year Sylvain spent a pleasant (!) afternoon removing every kwargs he could and replaced it with explicit parameter lists. And of course now we get the occassional bug resulting from one of us failing to update parameter defaults in all functions…\n",
      "But now that’s all in the past. We can use **kwargs again, and have the simpler and more reliable code thanks to DRY, and also a great experience for developers. 🎈 And the basic functionality of delegates() is just a few lines of code (source at bottom of article).\n",
      "Solving the problem with delegated composition\n",
      "For an alternative solution, let’s look again at the composition approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "class ProductPage:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, page, price, cost): self.page,self.price,self.cost = page,price,cost\n",
      "\n",
      "page = WebPage('Soap', category='Bathroom', author=\"Sylvain\")\n",
      "p = ProductPage(page, 15.0, 10.50)\n",
      "p.page.author\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sylvain'\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "How do we make it so we can just write p.author, instead of p.page.author. It turns out that Python has a great solution to this: just override __getattr__, which is called automatically any time an unknown attribute is requested:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "class ProductPage:\n",
      "    def __init__(self, page, price, cost): self.page,self.price,self.cost = page,price,cost\n",
      "    def __getattr__(self, k): return getattr(self.page,k)\n",
      "\n",
      "p = ProductPage(page, 15.0, 10.50)\n",
      "p.author\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Sylvain'\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",

You just have to set the default property in your object to the attribute you wish to delegate to, and everything else is automatic!

      "While the widespread adoption of data science and machine learning techniques has led to many positive discoveries, it also poses risks and is causing harm. Facial recognition technology sold by Amazon, IBM, and other companies has been found to have significantly higher error rates on Black women, yet these same companies are already selling facial recognition and predictive policing technology to police, with no oversight, regulations, or accountability. Millions of people’s photos have been compiled into databases, often without their knowledge, and shared with foreign governments, military operations, and police departments. Major tech platforms (such as Google’s YouTube, which auto-plays videos selected by an algorithm), have been shown to disproportionately promote conspiracy theories and disinformation, helping radicalize people into toxic views such as white supremacy.\n",

The first year will include a tech policy workshop, a data ethics seminar series, and data ethics courses, all of which will be open to the community at-large.\n",
      "Misuses of data and AI include the encoding & magnification of unjust bias, increasing surveillance & erosion of privacy, spread of disinformation & amplification of conspiracy theories, lack of transparency or oversight in how predictive policing is being deployed, and lack of accountability for tech companies. These problems are alarming, difficult, urgent, and systemic, and it will take the efforts of a broad and diverse range of people to address them. Many individuals, organizations, institutes, and entire fields are already hard at work tackling these problems. We will not reinvent the wheel, but instead will leverage existing tools and will amplify experts from a range of backgrounds. Diversity is a crucial component in addressing tech ethics issues, and we are committed to including a diverse range of speakers and supporting students and researchers from underrepresented groups.\n",

In the 3 years since the founding of the Data Institute, more than 900 entrepreneurs & employees from local tech companies have taken evening and weekend courses here, and we have granted more than 177 diversity scholarships to people from underrepresented groups. The USF MS in Data Science program, now housed in the Data Institute, is entering its 8th year, and all students complete 8 month practicum projects at our 160 partner companies. Jeremy Howard and I have both been involved with the USF Data Institute since it first began 3 years ago; it is where we have taught the in-person versions of our deep learning, machine learning, computational linear algebra, and NLP courses, and we have both been chairs of tracks for the Data Institute conference. Additionally, Jeremy launched the Wicklow AI in Medicine Research Initiative as part of the Data Institute last year.\n",

We are excited to have Deborah Raji as our first speaker.  Please join us on Monday August 19 for a reception with food and Deborah’s talk on “Actionable Auditing and Algorithmic Justice.”\n",
      "Tech Policy Workshop: Systemic problems require systemic solutions. Individual behavior change will not address the structural misalignment of incentives and lack of accountability. We need thoughtful and informed laws to safeguard human rights, and we do not want legislation written by corporate lobbyists. When it comes to setting policy in this area, too few legislators have the needed technical background and too few of those with knowledge of the tech industry have the needed policy background. We will hold a 3-day tech policy workshop, tentatively scheduled for November 15-17.\n",

      "A: We plan to release a data ethics course through fast.ai, sometime in mid-2020. (We have previously covered ethics issues in our Deep Learning for Coders course, and our recent A Code-First Intro to NLP included lessons on unjust bias and disinformation).  I will continue to blog here on the fast.ai site and am still committed to the fast.ai mission.\n",
      "Q: Given misuses of AI, isn’t your work at fast.ai to make AI accessible to more people dangerous?\n",
      "A: What is dangerous is having a homogeneous and exclusive group designing technology that impacts us all. Companies such as Amazon, Palantir, Facebook, and others are generally considered quite prestigious and only hire those with “elite” backgrounds, yet we can see the widespread harm these companies are causing. We need a broader and more diverse group of people involved with AI, both to take advantage of the positives, as well as to address misuses of the technology.

      "Today we are releasing a new course (taught by me), Deep Learning from the Foundations, which shows how to build a state of the art deep learning model from scratch. It takes you all the way from the foundations of implementing matrix multiplication and back-propogation, through to high performance mixed-precision training, to the latest neural network architectures and learning techniques, and everything in between. It covers many of the most important academic papers that form the foundations of modern deep learning, using “code-first” teaching, where each method is implemented from scratch in python and explained in detail (in the process, we’ll discuss many important software engineering techniques too). The whole course, covering around 15 hours of teaching and dozens of interactive notebooks, is entirely free (and ad-free), provided as a service to the community. The first five lessons use Python, PyTorch, and the fastai library; the last two lessons use Swift for TensorFlow, and are co-taught with Chris Lattner, the original creator of Swift, clang, and LLVM.\n",

This is particularly important nowadays because this field is moving so fast.  In this new course, we will learn to implement a lot of things that are inside the fastai and PyTorch libraries. In fact, we’ll be reimplementing a significant subset of the fastai library! Along the way, we will practice implementing papers, which is an important skill to master when making state of the art models.\n",

      "A huge amount of work went into the last two lessons—not only did the team need to create new teaching materials covering both TensorFlow and Swift, but also create a new fastai Swift library from scratch, and add a lot of new functionality (and squash a few bugs!) in Swift for TensorFlow. It was a very close collaboration between Google Brain’s Swift for TensorFlow group and fast.ai, and wouldn’t have been possible without the passion, commitment, and expertise of the whole team, from both Google and fast.ai. This collaboration is ongoing, and today Google is releasing a new version of Swift for TensorFlow (0.4) to go with the new course. For more information about the Swift for TensorFlow release and lessons, have a look at this post on the TensorFlow blog.\n",
      "In the remainder of this post I’ll provide a quick summary of some of the topics you can expect to cover in this course—if this sounds interesting, then get started now! And if you have any questions along the way (or just want to chat with other students) there’s a very active forum for the course, with thousands of posts already.\n",
      "Lesson 8: Matrix multiplication; forward and backward passes\n",
      "Our main goal is to build up to a complete system that can train Imagenet to a world-class result, both in terms of accuracy and speed. So we’ll need to cover a lot of territory.\n",

      "Our roadmap for training a CNN\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 1 is matrix multiplication! We’ll gradually refactor and accelerate our first, pure python, matrix multiplication, and in the process will learn about broadcasting and einstein summation. We’ll then use this to create a basic neural net forward pass, including a first look at how neural networks are initialized (a topic we’ll be going into in great depth in the coming lessons).\n",

      "Then we will implement the backwards pass, including a brief refresher of the chain rule (which is really all the backwards pass is). We’ll then refactor the backwards path to make it more flexible and concise, and finally we’ll see how this translates to how PyTorch actually works.\n",

      "In the last lesson we had an outstanding question about PyTorch’s CNN default initialization. In order to answer it, I did a bit of research, and we start lesson 9 seeing how I went about that research, and what I learned. Students often ask “how do I do research”, so this is a nice little case study.\n",
      "Then we do a deep dive into the training loop, and show how to make it concise and flexible. First we look briefly at loss functions and optimizers, including implementing softmax and cross-entropy loss (and the logsumexp trick). Then we create a simple training loop, and refactor it step by step to make it more concise and more flexible. In the process we’ll learn about nn.Parameter and nn.Module, and see how they work with nn.optim classes. We’ll also see how Dataset and DataLoader really work.\n",
      "Once we have those basic pieces in place, we’ll look closely at some key building blocks of fastai: Callback, DataBunch, and Learner. We’ll see how they help, and how they’re implemented. Then we’ll start writing lots of callbacks to implement lots of new functionality and best practices!\n",

      "Then we move on to the main topic of this lesson: looking inside the model to see how it behaves during training. To do so, we first need to learn about hooks in PyTorch, which allow us to add callbacks to the forward and backward passes. We will use hooks to track the changing distribution of our activations in each layer during training. By plotting this distributions, we can try to identify  problems with our training.\n",

Finally, we develop a new kind of normalization layer to overcome these problems, compare it to previously published approaches, and see some very encouraging results.\n",

He also provides some background on how Swift and TensorFlow fit together, both now and in the future. Next up, Chris shows a bit about using types to ensure your code has less errors, whilst letting Swift figure out most of your types for you. And he explains some of the key pieces of syntax we’ll need to get started.\n",
      "Chris also explains what a compiler is, and how LLVM makes compiler development easier. Then he shows how we can actually access and change LLVM builtin types directly from Swift!
